Open this project in VSCode and then re-open in a dev container.

![dev-container](./screenshots/dev-container.png)

Open a terminal within VSCode and follow the steps below.

1. Start the minikube cluster
```
minikube start
```
2. Create argocd namespace
```
kubectl create namespace argocd
```
3. Install argocd into the cluster
```
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```
4. Port forward the argocd UI to port 8080
```
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```
The API server can then be accessed using https://localhost:8080.
NOTE: This is a self signed cert, you will need to tell your browser to trust it.
5. Obtain the default password
```
argocd admin initial-password -n argocd
```
6. Login via the argocd CLI
```
argocd login localhost:8080
```
Username: admin
Password: <obtained in step 5>
7. Change the password if you'd like
```
argocd account update-password
``` 
8. Login to the UI!
```
User: admin
Password: <your_password>
```

## Deploy an Application

To get started we will deploy an application via the argocd UI.

1. Open the UI at https://localhost:8080 and login with the username and password you set up before.
2. Click `+ NEW APP`
3. Fill in the following information:
- `General` Section
- Applicaiton Name: `adservice`
- Project Name: select `default`
- Sync Policy: select `Automatic`
- `Source` Section
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/dillon-courts/gcp-microservices-deployment`
- Path: `adservice`
- `Destination` Section
- Cluster URL: Select `https://kubernetes.default.svc`
- Namespace: `default`
4. Click `CREATE` in the top left corner
5. You should see your new app and after a short time it will be marked as Synced and appear healthy.
6. Back in VSCode run `kubectl get all` from your terminal to view the resources generated by the argo app.
7. Go back into the UI and delete the app, we are going to recreate it in the next section.

## Deploy a Microservice Demo

We are going to deploy a microservices demo project that consists of 11 services.

1. Open terminal and run
```
chmod +x create-argo-apps.sh
./create-argo-apps.sh <url of the this repository in your github account> #ex: ./create-argo-apps.sh https://github.com/dillon-courts/argocd-demo
```
2. The script will create an argo application for each of the directories in this project and automatically sync them to your minikube cluster.
3. You can view all the apps in the argo UI.
4. Port forward the frontend
```
kubectl port-forward svc/frontend 8000:80
```
5. View the ecommerce website on http://localhost:8000

## Update a Deployment

1. Open the file `frontend/deployment.yml`
2. Comment out line 35 and uncomment line 36. This will modify which image the deployment is pointing to.
3. Push the change to your repository.
4. Wait for argocd to sync it or force a sync by clicking the `refresh` or `sync` buttons in the UI.
5. Navigate to the website to see the changes! Note you may need to hard refresh your browser to clear any cache.

## Rollback the deployment

1. Open the UI and navigate to the frontend argo instance
2. Click `History and Rollback`
3. Find the deployment you want to rollback to, click the menu buttons, and click rollback
4. You will be prompted that auto-sync must be disabled. Continue and watch as argo rolls back to the previous deployment.
5. Once the pod is up refresh the website again to see it back in the original state
